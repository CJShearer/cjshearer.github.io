          Hi, I'm Cody, a software developer with a commitment to efficiency and
          excellence. I'm passionate about enhancing productivity through
          platform engineering, refactoring to reduce complexity, or any other
          challenge offered by a full-stack role.

          Rather than simply addressing immediate challenges, I take pride in
          solving entire classes of problems, seeking to understand their root
          causes and addressing them holistically.

          My toolbox includes `Git`, `React-Native`, `TypeScript`, `Golang`,
          `Vue`, `Hugo`, `CircleCI`, `GitHub Actions`, `Fastlane`, `MySQL`,
          `MongoDB`, `Docker`, `Auth0`, and `Stripe`. I'm also eagerly exploring
          `Rust` and `WebAssembly` as a possible front-end replacement for
          `TypeScript`.

          *I am more than a programmer; I am a problem solver. These tools are
          not my limits, they are my foundation.*

          Led end-to-end development of a new `React-Native` app for
          [`iOS`](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rainwalk-pet-insurance/id6447000580)
          and
          [`Android`](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=rainwalk.insured),
          with a heavy focus on `GitOps` to enable rapid delivery with
          `Fastlane` and `CircleCI` and observability with `Sentry` and
          `LogRocket`. Generated long-term value by extracting reusable work as
          template for future projects. Empowered the client's independent
          maintenance of the app through workshops.

          Spearheaded the transition of the company's default backend
          deliverable from `Node.js` to `Golang` for improved type safety and
          developer experience. Assembled a Golang REST API template with tools
          and development processes as a platform familiar to Node.js
          developers. Improved time-to-delivery and synchronization of API and
          documentation with
          [`oapi-codegen`](https://github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen).

          Developed a `Vue PWA` and `Golang` integration for a construction
          company. Modernized the client's quality assurance workflow by
          replacing traditional paper-based forms and manual data entry with an
          offline-first mobile app. Seamlessly bridged new processes with
          existing legacy software, enhancing operational efficiency and
          accuracy.

          My time at USC has been fundamental in my development as problem
          solver and developer. My favorite courses were `Artificial
          Intelligence` and `Machine Learning Systems`.

          I also spent some of my free time as a member of the *Carolina
